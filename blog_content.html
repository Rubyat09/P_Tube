    <h1 class="text-4xl pb-2 font-extrabold">Scope of var, let, and const int javascript</h1>
    <p class="text-5xl "> In JavaScript, the scope of variables declared using var, let, and const varies, and
        understanding these scopes is essential for writing predictable and maintainable code. <br><br>
        <b>1. var</b><br><br>
        <b>Function Scope:</b> Variables declared with 'var' have function-level scope. This means they are accessible
        throughout the entire function in which they are defined. <br>

        <b>Hoisting:</b> Variables declared with 'var' are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global
        scope.
        This means that you can use the variable before it's declared in the code, but it will be undefined until the
        actual declaration is reached. <br>

        <b>Global Scope:</b> If 'var' is declared outside of any function, it becomes a global variable, accessible from
        anywhere in the script.<br><br>

        <b>2. let</b><br><br>
       <b>  Block Scope:</b>Variables declared with 'let' have block-level scope. They are limited to the block (enclosed by
        curly braces) in which they are defined.<br>
        <b>No Hoisting:</b> Unlike 'var', 'let' is not hoisted. It means you can't use the variable before its declaration
        within the same block.<br><br>
        <b>3. const</b><br><br>
       <b> Block Scope:</b> Similar to 'let', 'const' also has block-level scope.<br>
<b>Constant Value:</b> Variables declared with 'const' must be assigned a value when declared and cannot be reassigned after that. However, for objects and arrays declared with 'const', their properties or elements can still be modified.
    </p>




    <h1 class="text-4xl pb-2 font-extrabold">Use cases of null and undefined</h1>
    <p class="text-5xl"><b> null:</b> Represents the intentional absence of a value, often used to indicate that a variable or object property should have no value. <br><br>

       <b> undefined:</b> Represents uninitialized variables, function parameters without values, and missing object properties. It indicates the absence of an expected value.
    </p>


    <h1 class="text-4xl  font-extrabold">REST API</h1>
    <p class="text-5xl ">In JavaScript, a REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building web services. It allows you to use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources (e.g., data) on a server. REST APIs are commonly used to fetch or send data between a client (e.g., a web browser or mobile app) and a server, making it easier to build web applications that communicate with back-end systems.
